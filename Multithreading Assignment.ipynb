    "Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process. A thread is a lightweight sub-process that can perform tasks in parallel, sharing the same memory space as the main thread (the main program). Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, which means that multithreading is not very effective for CPU-bound tasks. However, it can still be useful for I/O-bound tasks where the threads spend a lot of time waiting for external resources, such as network requests or file I/O, as the GIL is often released during such waiting periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used to improve the responsiveness of applications, particularly those that involve I/O operations. By delegating time-consuming tasks to separate threads, the main thread can continue to respond to user input or other tasks without being blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the threading module is commonly used to handle threads. This module provides a way to create, manage, and coordinate threads. Here's a brief example of how you might use the threading module to create and start two threads:\n",

    "The threading module in Python is used to work with threads, allowing you to create, manage, and coordinate multiple threads within a single process. It provides an interface to create and control threads, making it easier to implement concurrent programming.

    "Certainly! These functions are part of the Thread class in Python's threading module and are used for managing and working with threads:\n",

    "(i) run(): This method is intended to be overridden in your custom thread class. It represents the entry point for the thread's activity. When you create a new thread object and call its start() method, it internally calls the run() method of that thread. You should define the behavior of the thread within the run() method.\n",

    "(i) Concurrency: Multithreading enables multiple tasks or operations to be executed concurrently. This can lead to improved performance and responsiveness, especially in applications with I/O-bound tasks.\n",

    "(i) Complexity: Multithreaded code can be more complex and harder to debug compared to single-threaded code. Issues like race conditions, deadlocks, and thread synchronization problems can arise.\n",

    "(iii) Deadlocks: Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for a resource that the other holds. This can freeze the application.\n",

    "A deadlock situation typically involves these four conditions:\n",

    "Race Conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions occur in a multithreaded or concurrent environment when the final outcome of an operation depends on the relative timing or order of execution of threads. These conditions can lead to unexpected and incorrect behavior because the program's behavior becomes unpredictable due to the interleaving of thread execution.\n",

    "Race conditions often occur when multiple threads access shared resources concurrently and at least one thread modifies the resource. These conditions can lead to data corruption, inconsistent program states, and other issues.
