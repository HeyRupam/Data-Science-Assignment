    "    In Python, you can add comments to your code to make it more readable and understandable for yourself and others who might be working on the code. There are two common ways to comment code in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "     (i). Single-line comments: To add a single-line comment, you can use the # symbol. Anything after the # symbol on the same line will be considered a comment and will be ignored by the Python interpreter. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # This is a single-line comment\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, World!\")  # This is another comment\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (ii). Multi-line comments: To add multi-line comments, you can enclose the comment within triple quotes (''' or \"\"\"). This is useful when you have longer comments that span multiple lines. Here's an example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    '''\n",
    "    This is a multi-line comment.\n",
    "    It can span multiple lines.\n",
    "    '''\n",

    "    In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They are essentially names or labels that represent a memory location where a value is stored. Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, lists, or more complex objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare and assign values to variables in Python, you can follow these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (i). Variable declaration: In Python, you don't need to explicitly declare variables or specify their types. You can simply assign a value to a variable, and Python will automatically determine the appropriate type based on the assigned value. Here's an example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this example, x is the variable, and 10 is the assigned value. Python will recognize x as an integer because it was assigned an integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (ii). Variable assignment: You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (=). The value on the right side of the = sign is assigned to the variable on the left side. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    name = \"John\"  \n",
    "    pi = 3.14159  \n",
    "    is_active = True  \n",
    "\n",
    "    You can also assign a value to multiple variables simultaneously using a technique called multiple assignment or tuple unpacking:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a = b = c = 0  \n",
    "    x, y, z = 1, 2, 3 "

    "    In Python, you can convert one data type to another using type conversion functions or techniques specific to each data type. Here are some common methods for data type conversion in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (i).Implicit type conversion (Coercion): Python automatically performs certain type conversions when it makes sense. For example, when you perform arithmetic operations involving different data types, Python automatically converts them to a common type. This is known as implicit type conversion or coercion. Here's an example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    x = 10  # integer\n",
    "    y = 3.5  # float\n",
    "\n",
    "    result = x + y  # The integer x is implicitly converted to float before the addition\n",
    "    print(result)  # Output: 13.5\n",
    "\n",
    "    (ii). Explicit type conversion (Type casting):\n",
    "    Python provides built-in functions to explicitly convert one data type to another. Here are some commonly used type conversion functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    int(): Converts a value to an integer.\n",
    "    float(): Converts a value to a floating-point number.\n",
    "    str(): Converts a value to a string.\n",
    "    bool(): Converts a value to a boolean.\n",
    "    Here are some examples:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    # Converting to integer\n",
    "    num_str = \"123\"\n",
    "    num_int = int(num_str)  # Converts the string \"123\" to an integer\n",
    "    print(num_int)  # Output: 123\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Converting to float\n",
    "    num_str = \"3.14\"\n",
    "    num_float = float(num_str)  # Converts the string \"3.14\" to a float\n",

    "    To write and execute a Python script from the command line, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (i). Open a text editor: Use any text editor of your choice (e.g., Notepad, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code) to write your Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (ii). Write your Python script: In the text editor, write your Python code following the Python syntax rules. For example, let's create a simple script that prints \"Hello, World!\":\n",

    "    (iv). Navigate to the script's directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your Python script is saved. For example, if your script is in the Documents folder, you would navigate to that folder by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "    (v). Execute the script: To execute the Python script, use the python command followed by the script's filename. For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    python my_script.py\n",
    "\n",
    "    This command will run the Python interpreter, which will execute the code in the specified script.\n",
