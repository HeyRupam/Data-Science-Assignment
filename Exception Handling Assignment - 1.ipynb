    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional situation arises, such as an error or unexpected condition, Python raises an exception. This allows you to handle errors and unexpected situations gracefully instead of having your program crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a built-in mechanism for handling exceptions using the try, except, else, and finally blocks. Here's how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) try block: This is where you place the code that might raise an exception. Python will monitor the code in this block for exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) except block: If an exception occurs within the try block, Python will jump to the corresponding except block that matches the type of exception raised. Inside the except block, you can specify how to handle the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) else block (optional): This block is executed if no exceptions occur in the try block. It's often used to specify code that should run only when no exceptions have been raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv) finally block (optional): This block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's typically used to clean up resources or perform actions that should happen regardless of exceptions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur when the code violates the rules of the programming language's syntax. These errors prevent the code from being interpreted or compiled successfully.\n",
    "(ii) Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the initial parsing phase before the code is executed.\n",
    "(iii) Common examples of syntax errors include missing colons at the end of if statements, mismatched parentheses, using invalid variable names, and other violations of the language's grammar rules.\n",
    "(iv) Since the code doesn't even get a chance to run, syntax errors are generally easier to catch and fix compared to other types of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program due to various reasons, such as invalid inputs, file not found, division by zero, etc.\n",
    "(ii) Exceptions are detected by the Python interpreter while the program is running, and they disrupt the normal flow of the program.\n",
    "(iii) Python provides a mechanism to handle exceptions using try, except, else, and finally blocks. This allows you to gracefully handle exceptional situations and prevent program crashes.\n",
    "(iv) There are different types of exceptions in Python, each representing a specific category of error. These include ZeroDivisionError, ValueError, FileNotFoundError, and many more."

    "Custom exceptions, also known as user-defined exceptions, allow you to define your own exception classes to represent specific error conditions that are relevant to your application. This can make your code more readable, maintainable, and allow you to handle errors in a more organized manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why you might need custom exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clarity and Readability: By creating custom exceptions, you can give specific names to errors that occur in your application. This makes the code more self-explanatory and easier to understand, as the exceptions will reflect the domain-specific errors that your application deals with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modularity: Custom exceptions can be organized into a hierarchy or module structure, which helps manage different types of errors more effectively. This way, you can group related errors together and handle them in a more consistent manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Separation of Concerns: Custom exceptions allow you to separate error handling logic from the main code. This can enhance the overall design of your program and make it easier to maintain and update.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Granular Error Handling: With custom exceptions, you can catch and handle errors at different levels of your code, allowing you to take appropriate actions depending on the nature of the error.\n",

    "    withdraw_from_account(account_balance, withdrawal_amount)\n",
    "except InsufficientFundsError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",

    "In this example, we've created a custom exception class InsufficientFundsError that takes the current account balance and the withdrawal amount as parameters. If the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance, we raise this custom exception. Otherwise, the withdrawal is successful.\n",
