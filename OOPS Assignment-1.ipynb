    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class and an object are fundamental concepts that help structure and model your code in a way that reflects the real-world entities and their interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class:\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects of that class will have. Think of a class as a set of instructions on how to create and interact with objects. It encapsulates the common characteristics and behaviors that a group of objects share.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object:\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete entity that is created based on the template defined by the class. An object has its own set of attributes and can perform actions based on the methods defined in its class. Objects allow you to work with data and behavior in a modular and organized way.\n",

    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation refers to the practice of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It hides the internal details of an object's implementation from the outside world and allows controlled access to the data through well-defined interfaces. Encapsulation helps in maintaining data integrity and preventing unintended interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential characteristics and behaviors of real-world entities. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction allows you to create a high-level view of an object and interact with it without needing to know the intricate implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "Inheritance allows you to create a new class (called a subclass or derived class) based on an existing class (called a superclass or base class). The subclass inherits the attributes and methods of the superclass, which promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchy among classes. It enables the creation of specialized classes that can add new features or modify existing ones while inheriting the common behavior from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. It allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably if they share a common interface. Polymorphism enables more flexible and dynamic programming by allowing a single interface to represent a group of related classes, each of which can provide its own implementation of methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars provide the foundation for designing and implementing object-oriented systems, leading to more organized, modular, and maintainable code structures.\n"

    "The __init__() function is a special method in Python that is used to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created from a class. It stands for \"initialize\" and is often referred to as the constructor. The __init__() method gets automatically called when you create an object from the class, and it allows you to set initial values for the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the use of __init__():\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",

    "Here's why self is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing Instance Attributes and Methods:\n",
    "Inside a class method, you often need to access the instance's attributes and methods. The self parameter provides a reference to the instance itself, allowing you to access and modify its attributes and call its methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance-specific Behavior:\n",
    "Each instance of a class can have its own unique data. By using self, you can access and manipulate the attributes of a specific instance. This allows objects to maintain their own state and behavior independently of other instances of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Ambiguity:\n",
    "When you have multiple instances of a class, using self helps the interpreter know which instance's attributes or methods you are referring to within a method. Without self, the interpreter might not know which instance's attributes you're trying to access, potentially leading to confusion or errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Calls:\n",
    "When you call a method on an instance (e.g., instance.method()), Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument to the method. By convention, this argument is named self, which allows the method to access the instance's attributes and methods.\n"

    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a new class (subclass or derived class) is created by inheriting properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). Inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, where the derived classes can reuse the attributes and methods of the base class while also adding their own unique features.\n",
