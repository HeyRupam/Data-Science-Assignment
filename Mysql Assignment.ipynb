    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of that data. Databases are commonly used in software applications to store and manage various types of information, ranging from simple lists to complex structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main categories of databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) databases and NoSQL databases. They differ in their data models, storage mechanisms, and the way they handle data.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Data Model: SQL databases use a structured data model based on tables with rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity or relationship, and rows in the table represent instances of that entity or relationship. The schema defines the structure of tables, including data types and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Query Language: SQL databases use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to interact with data. SQL provides a standardized way to define, manipulate, and retrieve data using commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) Schema: SQL databases have a rigid schema that defines the structure of the data beforehand. Changes to the schema often require careful planning and migration.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv) ACID Transactions: SQL databases emphasize strong consistency and support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions. This ensures that data remains accurate and reliable even in the face of system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Data Model: NoSQL databases use various data models, such as document-based, key-value, column-family, and graph-based. These models allow more flexible and dynamic representations of data, accommodating unstructured or semi-structured information.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Query Language: NoSQL databases often use non-SQL query languages or APIs tailored to the specific data model. These languages may be less standardized than SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) Schema: NoSQL databases typically have a more flexible schema. They can handle dynamic and evolving data structures without requiring a predefined schema. This agility is advantageous in scenarios where the data requirements change frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv) Consistency Models: NoSQL databases provide different consistency models, which range from strong consistency to eventual consistency. The emphasis may be on scalability and availability rather than strict consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB (document-based), Redis (key-value), Cassandra (column-family), Neo4j (graph-based)."

    "DDL stands for \"Data Definition Language,\" which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define and manage the structure of a database, including creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints. DDL statements do not manipulate the data within the tables; instead, they focus on defining the schema and organizational aspects of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are explanations for the DDL statements CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE, along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects like tables, indexes, or views.\n",
    "Example: Creating a table named \"Employees\" with columns for employee information.\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "        EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "        FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n",

    "The DROP statement is used to delete or remove existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views.\n",
    "Example: Dropping the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "    DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "c. ALTER:\n",
    "The ALTER statement is used to modify or alter the structure of existing database objects. It can be used to add, modify, or delete columns, constraints, or indexes.\n",
    "Example: Adding a new column \"Salary\" to the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "    ADD Salary DECIMAL(10, 2);\n",
    "d. TRUNCATE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE statement is used to quickly remove all data from a table, effectively resetting the table to an empty state. Unlike the DELETE statement, TRUNCATE doesn't log individual row deletions, making it faster but less flexible (no WHERE clause allowed).\n",
    "Example: Truncating the data from the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "    TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n"

    "Primary Key and Foreign Key are two essential concepts in relational databases that help establish relationships between tables and ensure data integrity. They play a key role in maintaining the integrity and structure of the database by enforcing rules about how data is linked and referenced across tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A Primary Key is a unique identifier for each row (record) within a table. It ensures that each row has a distinct and non-null value that can be used to uniquely identify that row. Primary Keys are crucial for maintaining data integrity, as they prevent duplicate or null values from being entered into the column.\n",
    "Key characteristics of a Primary Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column must be unique across all rows in the table.\n",
    "b. Non-null: A primary key value cannot be NULL, as it must uniquely identify each row.\n",
    "c. Indexed: Primary key columns are usually automatically indexed by the database management system, allowing for efficient searches and retrieval.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider an \"Employees\" table. An \"EmployeeID\" column could be designated as the primary key. Each employee's ID in this column would be unique, allowing easy identification of individual employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A Foreign Key is a column or set of columns in a table that establishes a link between the data in two tables. It creates a relationship between tables by referencing the primary key of another table. The purpose of a foreign key is to ensure referential integrity by enforcing that values in the foreign key column correspond to values in the primary key column of another table.\n",
    "Key characteristics of a Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. References Primary Key: The foreign key column references the primary key column of another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.\n",
    "b. Maintains Data Consistency: A foreign key ensures that data in the related tables remains consistent by preventing operations that would break referential integrity.\n",
    "c. Supports Data Relationships: Foreign keys enable the creation of relationships between tables, such as one-to-many or many-to-many relationships.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Continuing with the \"Employees\" table example, let's say there's a \"DepartmentID\" column in the \"Employees\" table that corresponds to the \"DepartmentID\" primary key column in a \"Departments\" table. The \"DepartmentID\" in the \"Employees\" table would be a foreign key, establishing a relationship between employees and their respective departments."
