    "In Python, data types can be categorized as either mutable or immutable based on whether their values can be changed after they are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable data types are those whose values cannot be modified once they are created. When you perform operations that appear to modify an immutable object, a new object is created with the updated value. Examples of immutable data types in Python include integers, floats, strings, and tuples.\n",
    "\n",

When we try to modify string1 by concatenating \" World\" to it, a new string object is created with the updated value. The original value of string1 remains unchanged, as evidenced by the output when printing string1 and string2.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, mutable data types are those that allow in-place modifications to their values. This means you can modify the object directly without creating a new object. Examples of mutable data types in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example showcasing the mutability of lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "    list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",

    "In this example, we have a list list1 initially containing the elements [1, 2, 3]. When we modify list1 by appending the value 4 to it, the original list is modified in-place. Since list2 references the same underlying list object, it reflects the changes made to list1, as evidenced by the identical output of list1 and list2.\n",
